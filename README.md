# textmechallenge

Very simple interface. After running python manage.py runserver and going to http://127.0.0.1/bitly/, you will be given two checkboxes,
one for Url and Short (shortened version). If you click on Url, it gives you a text box for which to add your Url. Once you press submit, 
it'll take you to a page with the shortened Url. A button will appear to resolve it, taking you to another page with the original Url. 
Then you can go back to the index and input another Url. The Short option takes you to a page where you can put the short Url in an 
attempt to get the longer one back. If it succeeds, then it'll take you to the page with the longer Url. Otherwise it gives you an error 
message
